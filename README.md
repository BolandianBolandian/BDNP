# BDNP
a Machine Learning model for predicting the future of the USD/IRR and stock market in Iran.

# How does this ML model work?
In general, the mission of this ML model is to predict the best market for investment in the next period, this is why we call it "BDNP" -Best Decision in Next Period- . in this way, different information (29 features) from the Iranian stock market and the USD/IRR market is given to the model and it makes the desired prediction for us.
In other words, this model was created to answer this question:
In the next 6 days in IRAN, if I have some money to invest, which is the best option between the Iranian stock market and the US dollar?

**Why the next 6 days?**
You probably know that Iran's economy is unstable with high annual and monthly inflation.
According to the information we had from the archives of the Iranian stock market and the dollar, and many investigations that took place, we concluded that the created artificial intelligence model will have the highest efficiency and the most accurate forecast for 6-day periods (working days), so the inputs The model is in the form of 6-day periods and the output of the model is also suitable for 6-day periods.
